		When Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, three weeks ago, many experts downplayed its implications for the U.S. economy, which had entered 2022 with great momentum. 'The impact of the Russian invasion on the U.S. economy will be on the margins,' Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, wrote. Since then, though, there has been a reassessment. Late last week, the economics team at Goldman Sachs projected that U.S. G.D.P. would expand by just 1.75 per cent from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this year—a sharp decline from the 5.

		The twenty-six-year-old singer-songwriter Nilüfer Yanya tends to make music that indulges her worst impulses. Yanya has a singular voice—a disarming rasp that turns every note into a smoldering ember—and her restless pop-rock songs circle her feelings of emptiness and inadequacy. 'I've hit bottom rock / Swear I'm telling the truth / But, down here I'm dark and confused / Although I cannot tell if I'm paranoid / Or it's all in my head,' Yanya wails, on 'In Your Head,' from 2019. Her singing is fuzzy and distorted through the song's hysterical verses, building on squalls of electric guitar, until the instruments cut out.

		'HIGHEST GAS PRICES IN HISTORY!' Donald Trump said in a statement that he issued last Tuesday. 'DO YOU MISS ME YET?' The answer is no. The world could hardly be at a more dangerous juncture, with a catastrophe in Ukraine that could spiral into a wider war—perhaps even a nuclear one. One of the few blessings of the moment is that our own nuclear arsenal is not in the hands of a Twitter-happy tantrum-thrower beholden to his own vanity. At a speech in New Orleans this month, according to the Washington Post, Trump mooted the idea of putting China's flag on American planes and sending them to bomb Russia: 'Then they start fighting with each other and we sit back and watch.

		Your story 'Wood Sorrel House' involves a couple and their toddler, staying at a classic summer rental in the country, which turns out to be anything but classic. How did the idea of turning a usually idyllic vacation into a nightmare of isolation and timelessness occur to you? Was it inspired by living through the pandemic with a young child?Photograph by Rosalie OsbornOur son turned two in March of 2020, so the story absolutely took on that dimension. But I first wrote a basic outline several weeks before things shut down in the United States.

		Last Tuesday, when Matt Kent picked up his sixteen-year-old son, Jackson, from an appointment, Jackson could tell that 'something was off,' he said. Matt is a pilot with a neat beard and a controlled manner, but something had disturbed his typical restraint. He didn't tell Jackson what was wrong right away. 'I wanted to gather my thoughts before unleashing something dumb out of my mouth,' Matt said when we spoke a few days later.

		In late October, I found an unexpected gift waiting at the bottom of my freezer. Hidden beneath a sliced boule of sourdough and a box of wedding cake was a parcel of beef short ribs wrapped in mauve butcher paper—a forgotten remnant of one ambitious weekend dinner plan or another, neglected for the convenience of roti takeout or pizza delivery. Unwrapping the package, I marvelled at the pale striations of fat streaking across the crimson flesh, bold and elegant like an ink-wash painting of a mountainside.

		What are we looking at when we look at a stolen bag of Huggies? Last month, the New York Police Department's verified Twitter account shared the news that officers in the Bronx had 'arrested 12 individuals following an enforcement initiative targeting shoplifters,' adding, 'The arrests made led to the closure of 23 warrants and the recovery of $1800 worth of merchandise.' Accompanying the tweet were photographs of three policemen and a carefully arranged display of the stolen items, which included bar soap, laundry detergent, cough medicine, baby lotion, baby wipes, and several boxes and bags of diapers.

		Lucky are those for whom the benefits of vigorous exercise are more or less the unintentional effects of something they love to do. I am not one of them. My friends have heard me declare that I like to swim, but what I really like is not so much moving purposefully through water as being immersed in it, like a tea bag. I like to walk, but would I do it quite so much if I had not, in a self-sabotaging form of rebellion against the Southern California car culture in which I grew up, refused to learn to drive? During the pandemic, I secretly relished the fact that my yoga classes had switched to Zoom; at home, with my camera turned off, I could look at my phone or play with the dog when other students were asking the instructor to help them refine their asanas.
