1. Translating the French Election for the Freedom-Fry Audience
		Only twenty-seven days remain before the first round of the French Presidential election, but it wasn't until the beginning of March that the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron, got around to formally entering the race. There were strategic reasons for the slow rollout, but, as Russia's assault on Ukraine intensified, a showy announcement seemed inappropriate, leading Macron to cancel a rally in Marseille. The contrast between Macron's schedule and those of the other candidates was kickoff enough. 'On Monday, conservative candidate Valérie Pécresse (Les Républicains) visited the iconic Salon de l'Agriculture, a national farming fair which takes place every year in the south of Paris,' Gilles Paris noted, in Le Monde.

3. The Revolution Eats Itself in Nicaragua
		Nicaragua is a small, hot Central American country made beautiful by a few perfect volcanoes and two glassy lakes. It doesn't register much attention abroad, and yet, in the late years of the Cold War, the world was anxiously focussed on events there. A young, ragtag army under the leadership of something called the Sandinista National Liberation Front looked like it just might manage to overthrow the forty-three-year dictatorship of the Somoza-family dynasty and its brutal Guardia Nacional. Socialist but emphatically not communist, the Sandinistas promised their followers in Nicaragua and beyond a new solution to the endless problem of poverty and inequality in the region.

4. At Home with the Families Affected by Texas's New Anti-Trans Orders
		Last Tuesday, when Matt Kent picked up his sixteen-year-old son, Jackson, from an appointment, Jackson could tell that 'something was off,' he said. Matt is a pilot with a neat beard and a controlled manner, but something had disturbed his typical restraint. He didn't tell Jackson what was wrong right away. 'I wanted to gather my thoughts before unleashing something dumb out of my mouth,' Matt said when we spoke a few days later.

5. Naftali Bennett's Calculated Effort to Engage with Vladimir Putin on Ukraine—and Iran
		On Saturday night, while Russian forces entered the Ukrainian city of Volnovakha, and blocked convoys of food and medicine intended for the nearby besieged city of Mariupol, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's President, called Naftali Bennett, the Israeli Prime Minister. The two spoke for more than an hour and discussed, Zelensky tweeted, 'Russian aggression and the prospects for peace talks'—which, earlier in the day, Zelensky had suggested might take place in Jerusalem. Genuine negotiations would be impossible in Ukraine, Russia, or Belarus, he told reporters: 'These are not places where we can come to any understandings on ending the war—I'm not talking about technical meetings but meetings between leaders.

6. Is It Time to Call Putin's War in Ukraine Genocide?
		'We have to call this what it is,' Volodymyr Zelensky said, late last month, a few days after Vladimir Putin had ordered the invasion and conquest of Ukraine. 'Russia's criminal actions against Ukraine show signs of genocide.' President Zelensky, who lost family members during the Holocaust, and who also happens to have a law degree, sounded suitably cautious about invoking genocide, and he called for the International Criminal Court in The Hague to send war-crimes investigators as a first step. But such investigations take years, and rarely result in convictions.
