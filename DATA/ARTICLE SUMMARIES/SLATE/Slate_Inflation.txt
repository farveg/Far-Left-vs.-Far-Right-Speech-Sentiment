		Maryland is planning a 30-day gas tax holiday. GOP Gov. Larry Hogan and the state's Democratic-controlled legislature announced an agreement to suspend the 37-cent-a-gallon levy on Thursday. It's the first state policy put in place to ease the high price of gas, which has climbed by almost a dollar in the last month, but probably not the last: The National Conference of State Legislatures says more than a dozen states are considering similar moves. Earlier this week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a gas tax rebate.

		Gas prices hit an all-time high this week, according to AAA, and many Americans seem to be in disbelief. It hasn't been that long: The last time we had a run of high gas prices was from 2011 to 2014. True, prices then maxed out at just under $4 a gallon. But adjusted against wages or inflation, prices felt even higher then. It was a major issue in the 2012 presidential campaign. We adapted—by fracking the hell out of the Great Plains and becoming the world's top oil producer—and the issue was basically forgotten.

		There is nothing the NFL cares more about than the integrity of its product. At first that sounds like brandspeak from a league that loves to tell you about how it's more than just a money-printing machine. But in the NFL, competitive integrity and cash go hand in hand. NFL games are by far the most-watched television broadcasts in the country, and the league's broadcast partners shower it with billions of dollars to air those games. People watch because football is fun, but also because of a foundational truth about live sports: We don't know who's going to win.
